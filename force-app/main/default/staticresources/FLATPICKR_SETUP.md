# Flatpickr Static Resource

To use Flatpickr in this component, you need to:

1. Download Flatpickr from https://flatpickr.js.org/
2. Create a ZIP file containing:
   - flatpickr.min.js
   - flatpickr.min.css
3. Upload it as a Static Resource named 'flatpickr' in Salesforce

For now, the component will fall back to the FullCalendar date selection.
